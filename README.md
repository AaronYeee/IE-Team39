BackGround：
Children are our future! This project aims to promote early childhood education and care for migrant children. This website focuses on the resolving issues faced by the migrant parents living in Victoria, Australia. 

Description：
This is stage 1 of our website.
the main functionality of our Iteration 1 is to ensure that the message of encouraging migrant parents and parents in general to enrol their children into Kindergartens is spread across. 

In order to fulfill this, Iteration1 aims:
to spread awareness about the importance of Kindergarten in early childhood development and share knowledge about Kindergarten participation in Victorian suburbs. 
This iteration will also include data visualisations that will assist the migrant parents to make informed decisions based on statistical data provided by our website
