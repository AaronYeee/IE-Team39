                                    Kindergartens play an important role in a child's development. It’s an integral part of early childhood development. The first five years are the foundational years of a child’s life. They learn the most in the first five years of their childhood. Kindergartens create new experiences for children of age three to four-year old so that they learn life skills before starting school. Your child will develop essential skills such as social, emotional and problem-solving abilities that will become the building blocks of their future.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Because it’s fun to play - children find it easy to pick on new skills while playing. Curiosity comes naturally to children and they are always exploring. Kindergartens provide children a play-based learning environment where your child will learn to talk, read, think and write. Play is a powerful tool that enhances your child’s cognitive development and develops motor skills. At Kindergarten’s screen time is limited for the child.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Kindergarten teaches children to learn alongside others, work and accept peers regardless of their race, culture or religion. They are taught equality at a very young age by teaching them through books and play about the similarities in different cultures. Kindergartens will ensure that the interests and abilities and culture of every child is understood and valued.

                                </p>

                                    Kindergartens instill self confidence in your child as they learn to build critical thinking abilities naturally through play and develop self-awareness by listening and observing and learning something new every day. This will set the foundation for future behaviour and enhance the learning capacity of your child.

                                    Sharing is essential skills for social and emotional development of a child. It must be inculcated into a child as to some children it might not come naturally but some find it easier to share. Kindergartens teach your child how to share and care for others by encouraging play games that involve sharing with other children and reward based positive reinforcement as this will motivate your child to internalise sharing easily.
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="content-subhead">Our Children and Families</h2>
                                <p>
                                    It is important we are both safe and practical when it comes to our policies around health, safety and wellbeing. We know parents are busy, so our policies – whilst grounded in safety – also consider life’s practicalities.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Drop off and pick-up:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We know mornings and evenings can be a busy time for parents, so we make drop-offs and pick-ups as seamless as possible with electronic sign in and sign out. However, there are certain procedures that must take place to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the children in our care.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For example, required attendance records and confirmation the child’s presence or absence must be recorded.  This ensures the accuracy of the number of children in attendance and that the correct child to staff ratios are being met. That is why it is important that families sign their child in at the start of the day and out at the end of the day. It also means your attendance is recorded accurately for any Child Care Subsidies you may be receiving.
                                </p><br /><br />

                                <p>We has a duty of care for every child attending our Centres. This exists while a child is on the Centre’s premises even if he/she hasn’t yet been signed in or has been signed out but is still on the premises. That is why we also have strict guidelines on why and how your child can leave the Centre premises:</p>

                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A parent or nominee collects the child, provides written authorisation for the child to leave or to attend an excursion</li>
                                        <li>The child requires medical, hospital or ambulance treatment, or there is another emergency.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p>Wellbeing and nutrition:</p>

                                <p>Educating children about the importance of healthy eating and good nutrition is an important part of early childhood development. We believe in providing a positive eating environment that reflects dietary requirements, cultural and family values, and promotes lifelong learning for children.</p>

                                <p>We are committed to promoting and supporting healthy food and drink choices that meet the requirements for children according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines. We also value families’ contributions to menu planning because we know this is the best way to extend healthy habits from the Centre into the home and beyond. Specifically:</p>

                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We always follow through health and hygiene practices for handling, preparing and storing food.</li>
                                        <li>Children always have access to food and water throughout the day</li>
                                        <li>Children’s individual dietary requirements are catered for and we work together with families to support each child’s needs</li>
                                        <li>Positive mealtime experiences through education and role-modelling of healthy eating practices.</li>

                                            Maintaining your child’s enrolment means you won’t have to find an available place again post-COVID-19. Places may be hard to find in some areas depending on the demand for childcare.

                                            There is no financial benefit to removing your child from care. Under the Child Care Subsidy (CCS), families are allowed 42 absence days per child, per financial year. These can be taken for any reason without the need for families to provide documentation. For example, a child who usually attends 3 days per week can access 14 weeks of absences before additional absences are needed. Where a child has used all of their 42 absence days, and they cannot attend because of COVID-19 related reasons, additional absence days can be used without the requirement to provide medical evidence.

                                    In VIC, the Nation Quality Framework is administered by the Victoria State government and the Australian Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) approving qualified servers and providers, assessing and rating quality and checking for conformance to requirements of Nation Law and Nation Regulation. More information about the authorized regulations refer to Regulatory Framework concerning <a id="dialog1" href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/childhood/providers/regulation/Regframework.pdf">Education and Care Services in Victoria</a>.<br />

                                    Some other early childhood services are regulated under Victorian state law, Victorian Children’s Services Act 1996. The services they provide usually are occasional and mobile care services and non-funded services.<br />
